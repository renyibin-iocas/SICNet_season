# SICNet_season
Seasonal sea ice prediction model based on transformer.

The core code of the model is in the .py files. The jupyter file contains the flow of reading source data, defining a model, and training/testing the model. The satellite-observed sea ice concentration is obtained from the following site https://nsidc.org/data/NSIDC-0081/versions/1. The reanalysis of sea ice thickness data is open access (http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/model_grid). The seasonal predictions of SEAS5 are available from the ECMWF (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/seasonalï¿½monthly-single-levels?tab=form).
